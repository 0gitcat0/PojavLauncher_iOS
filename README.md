## Introduction
- Not finished yet!
- There's no eta on this project.

## How can it work?
- Use OpenJDK 16 from Procursus to get real Java environment.
- (Temporary) Use JavaFX to get a fresh GLES context.
- Use GL4ES for OpenGL -> OpenGL ES translator.
- Use our [LWJGL3 iOS port](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3).
- Use same launch method as PojavLauncher Android.

## Installing OpenJDK 16
- Download [openjdk-16-jre â€¢ Procursus](https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/repository/procursus/package/openjdk-16-jre) .deb file (~40mb).

### For jailbroken iOS device (without Procursus)
- ssh to iOS or use a terminal, type these commands
```
# Grant root access
su

# Install use dpkg
dpkg -i /path/to/openjdk-16-jre.deb

# Verify if java is installed
/usr/lib/jvm/java-16-openjdk/bin/java -version
```

### For non-jailbroken devices
- idk maybe unpack deb file?
